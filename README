DailyUpdate version 4.4

DailyUpdate is an information integrator. It creates a custom web page from a
template HTML file with special tags, replacing those tags with dynamic
information acquired from the internet.

DailyUpdate needs LWP::UserAgent from the libwww library, URI::URL, and
HTML::Parser. Get them from CPAN at %CPAN%/modules/by-module/LWP/.

New in version 4.4: Separated configuration from main script (yea!). Fixed
"uninitialized variable" warnings. Created user-submitted schemas webpage at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/schemas.html. Added more data
acquisition schemas.

New in version 4.4: Added Infoworld, and Adam@Home. Changed date & time
handlers to take any valid strftime format string, and made url attribute to
weather mandatory. Changed CoolSite to use their logo. Script only dumps to
screen if called as a cgi script. Added default values to date, time, and
OutputListOrColumns.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) Keep
in mind that I'm likely to turn down obscure features to avoid including
everything but the kitchen sink.
