DailyUpdate version 4.3

!If anyone knows how I can move the %tagToHandler and other config variables
to another file, please tell me. I can't seem to figure out the scoping
correctly... -- Thanks!

DailyUpdate is an information integrator. It creates a custom web page from a
template HTML file with special tags, replacing those tags with dynamic
information acquired from the internet.

DailyUpdate needs LWP::UserAgent from the libwww library, URI::URL, and
HTML::Parser. Get them from CPAN at %CPAN%/modules/by-module/LWP/.

New in version 4.3: Added Infoworld, and Adam@Home. Changed date & time
handlers to take any valid strftime format string, and made url attribute to
weather mandatory. Changed CoolSite to use their logo. Script only dumps to
screen if called as a cgi script. Added default values to date, time, and
OutputListOrColumns. 

New in version 4.2: Added "linuxtoday", and "time".  Modified GetText &
GetLinks to take "^" and "\$" signifying start and end of file. Added proxy
support. Fork is now disabled on Windows platforms. Moved from HTML::Parse to
HTML::Parser.

Send me email if you would like to be notified of updates.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) Keep
in mind that I'm likely to turn down obscure features to avoid including
everything but the kitchen sink.
