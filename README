DailyUpdate version 4.1

DailyUpdate is an information integrator. It creates a custom web page from a
template HTML file with special tags, replacing those tags with dynamic
information acquired from the internet.

DailyUpdate needs libwww for Perl. Get it from CPAN at
%CPAN%/modules/by-module/LWP/.

New in version 4.1: Added "User Friendly" and "Freshmeat" support. Fixed
Slashdot so that it takes a style. Changed it to use LWP instead of my own
HTTP sockets stuff.

New in version 4.0: This is a total rewrite, resulting in a modular,
extensible script that is half the size of the previous version.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) Keep
in mind that I'm likely to turn down obscure features to avoid including
everything but the kitchen sink.
