DailyUpdate version 5.1

DailyUpdate is an information integrator. It creates a custom web page from a
template HTML file with special tags, replacing those tags with dynamic
information acquired from the internet.

Send me email if you would like to be notified of updates.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) Keep
in mind that I'm likely to turn down obscure features to avoid including
everything but the kitchen sink.


CHANGES

New in version 5.1: 
- Update times are now set by the handlers by overriding GetUpdateTimes. (The
  default is 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23.) Users can also customize the update times
  in the configuration file, if they don't like the ones given by the
  handlers. Modified MakeHandler.pl to support this.
- Fixed a caching bug that would cause (a) multiple copies of some data when a
  tag is used more than once on the same page, and (b) reuse of cached data
  even when the style has been changed.
- Added -a flag for automatic download of handlers.
- Added -n flag to check for new versions of handlers.
- Fixed prerequisites.
- Removed use of the deprecated HTML::Parse in AcquisitionFunctions.pm

New in version 5.0.2: 
- Fixed data caching.
- MakeHandler.pl now stores the URL in the comment block.
- Created POD documentation in DailyUpdate.pl
- Fixed a problem with the loading of configuration information


PREREQUISITES

You will need Perl version 5.004 or newer. In addition, Daily Update uses the
libwww library (LWP), URI, HTML-Tree, and HTML::Parser, all of which are
available on CPAN at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/.


INSTALLATION

- Quick Start

Run 'DailyUpdate.pl -n -a' from the command line. Look at the template.txt
file and the output.html file. See
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/DailyUpdate/handlers.html for more
tags.

Since the example template isn't too exciting, you may want to take your
normal homepage and jazz it up with the Daily Update tags. Change the inHtml
and outHtml variables in the DailyUpdate.cfg file.

Try 'pod2text DailyUpdate.pl' for documentation, or visit the web page at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/DailyUpdate/index.html.

- Detailed Installation

If you plan to run Daily Update from a cron job, you will probably have to use
the #!/path/perl syntax for the first line of the DailyUpdate.pl file.

Handlers are put in $INSTALL/DailyUpdate/Handler/. If you later move them to
directory $SOMEWHERE/DailyUpdate/Handler/, add $SOMEWHERE to the
handlerlocations variable in the configuration file. Similarly, if you move
the DailyUpdate.pl and DailyUpdate.cfg files to another directory (like
cgi-bin), be sure to update the handlerlocations variable.
