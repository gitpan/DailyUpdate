DailyUpdate version 6.01

Written by David Coppit (coppit@cs.virginia.edu,

DailyUpdate is an information integrator. It creates a custom web page from a
template HTML file with special tags, replacing those tags with dynamic
information acquired from the internet.

Send me email if you would like to be notified of updates.

Please send me any modifications you make to the main script. (for the better,
that is. :) Keep in mind that I'm likely to turn down obscure features to
avoid including everything but the kitchen sink. Check out the TODO file for
ways you can help.

If you make a nice web page using Daily Update and want to show it off, send
me an email and I'll add it to the examples. Thanks!

CHANGES

New in version 6.02:
- Added return values for those of you who like to use makefiles to build web
  pages.
- Added documentation for MakeHandler.pl.
- Bug fixed in output columns function. (Thanks to Craig Brockmeier
  <craig@seurat.ppco.com> for finding it.)
- I've revamped the configuration and install procedure to make it more
  amenable to site-wide installation. DailyUpdate.cfg is looked for in
  ~/.DailyUpdate, and handlers are installed in the first directory specified
  by handlerlocations in DailyUpdate.cfg. (~/.DailyUpdate by default.) You'll
  need to fix up your handlerLocations variable if you're upgrading from a
  previous version. (Thanks to John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org> for his
  invaluable input.)
- Added support for proxies requiring passwords. (Thanks to Kevin D.
  Clark <kclark@cabletron.com>.)
- Fixed a bug in HTMLTools.pm. (Thanks to Mark Harburn
  <Mark.Harburn@durham.ac.uk>).

New in version 6.01: 
- Added -r switch to force proxies to reload cached data during data
  acquisition. (Thanks to Gerhard Wiesinger <e9125884@student.tuwien.ac.at>)
- Fixed a couple of minor bugs.
- Improved installation to automatically set #! line and set INSTALLDIRECTORY
  in DailyUpdate.pl.
- Configuration doesn't have to be in the same directory as the DailyUpdate.pl
  file. (You can leave the DailyUpdate.cfg file in the install directory, and
  move the DailyUpdate.pl file wherever you want, like cgi-bin.)
- During automatic installation, handlers are now put in the install
  directory, not the directory of the currently running DailyUpdate.pl script.


PREREQUISITES

You will need Perl version 5.004 or newer. In addition, Daily Update uses the
libwww library (LWP), URI (NOT URI::URL!), HTML-Tree, and HTML::Parser. You
can download these packages with the following URLs:
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/LWP/libwww-perl-5.41.tar.gz
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/URI/URI-1.00.tar.gz
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/HTML/HTML-Tree-0.51.tar.gz
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/HTML/HTML-Parser-2.22.tar.gz


INSTALLATION

Installation is semi-interactive, and pretty much self-explanatory. I'm still
ironing out the installation bugs, so please let me know if this can be
improved.

DOS/Windows folks: you may have to use nmake or dmake instead of make. Also,
PREFIX seems to be ignored in Windows. Sorry, but you'll have to do a
system-wide install.

- System-wide installation

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

You may want to edit the sytem-wide DailyUpdate.cfg file in order to point
handlerLocations to any system-supported handlers that all users can use.

Users should copy DailyUpdate.cfg to ~/.DailyUpdate.cfg if they want to modify
the configuration. (To set the input and output files, for example.

- Single User installation (Doesn't work on DOS/Windows)

perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=perl PREFIX=/path INSTALLMAN1DIR=/path/man/man1
make
make pure_perl_install DailyUpdate_Cleanup

Add /path/lib/perl5 to your PERL5LIB environment variable, using something
like:
set PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/path/lib/perl5;export PERL5LIB

You'll have to manually move the man file from the install directory to your
favorite man location, or set your MANPATH to include the install directory's
man subdirectory.

- General information

Configuration information is first looked for in ~/.DailyUpdate, and
then in the system-wide location specified during installation.

The distribution comes with an example input file, template.txt, and a handler
generator, MakeHandler.pl. (The latter is installed with DailyUpdate.pl.)

If you have problems, see the FAQ at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/DailyUpdate/faq.html


RUNNING

Run 'DailyUpdate.pl -na -i template.txt -o output.html' from the command line.
Look at the template.txt file and the output.html file. See
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/DailyUpdate/handlers.html for more
tags.

Since the example template isn't too exciting, you may want to take your
normal homepage and jazz it up with the Daily Update tags. Change the inHtml
and outHtml variables in the DailyUpdate.cfg file.

Try 'perldoc DailyUpdate.pl' for documentation, or visit the web page at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/DailyUpdate/index.html.
