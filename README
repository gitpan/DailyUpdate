DailyUpdate version 4.5

DailyUpdate is an information integrator. It creates a custom web page from a
template HTML file with special tags, replacing those tags with dynamic
information acquired from the internet.

DailyUpdate needs LWP::UserAgent from the libwww library, URI::URL, and
HTML::Parser. Get them from CPAN at %CPAN%/modules/by-module/LWP/.

New in version 4.5: Added acquisition function GetHtml. Added -i and -o flags
for input and output files. Now reads old html file only once (faster).  Added
"always" schema time option. Now checks script directory for configuration
file. Miscellaneous bug fixes, new data sources, and minor enhancements.

New in version 4.4: Separated configuration from main script (yea!). Fixed
"uninitialized variable" warnings. Created user-submitted schemas webpage at
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dwc3q/code/schemas.html. Added more data
acquisition schemas.

Please send me any modifications you make. (for the better, that is. :) Keep
in mind that I'm likely to turn down obscure features to avoid including
everything but the kitchen sink.
