The purpose of this document is twofold: to give you an idea of what I'd like
to do in future versions of DailyUpdate, and to give you an idea of what you
can help me implement. :)

- Tooltips: Some website present information-less headlines, and a blurb
  explaining the headline. It would be nice if the blurb popped up when the
  user's mouse moved over the link.
- Improved acquisition/output methods: Right now, the user writes Perl code to
  acquire the data and output it. Since the code has to work within the
  context of HandleGeneric, it has to use @grabbedData. This results in
  wierdness like GetText returning it's data in the first element of the
  @grabbedData array.
- Real manipulation of the output HTML syntax tree: Right now I just output a
  hunk of HTML when a tag is seen. But for more advanced stuff, like
  javascript in the header, I should really be manipulating the abstract
  syntax tree for the output HTML.
