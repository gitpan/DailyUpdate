The purpose of this document is twofold: to give you an idea of what I'd like
to do in future versions of DailyUpdate, and to give you an idea of what you
can help me implement. :) Also, if you have any thoughts on these, please let
me know.

- Tooltips: Some website present information-less headlines, and a blurb
  explaining the headline. It would be nice if the blurb popped up when the
  user's mouse moved over the link.
- Real manipulation of the output HTML syntax tree: Right now I just output a
  hunk of HTML when a tag is seen. But for more advanced stuff, like
  javascript in the header, I should really be manipulating the abstract
  syntax tree for the output HTML.
- Version check for modules: Have the script automatically check for new
  versions of handlers, and install them automatically.
