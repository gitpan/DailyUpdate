The purpose of this document is twofold: to give you an idea of what I'd like
to do in future versions of DailyUpdate, and to give you an idea of what you
can help me implement. :) Also, if you have any thoughts on these, please let
me know.

- Tooltips: Some website present information-less headlines, and a blurb
  explaining the headline. It would be nice if the blurb popped up when the
  user's mouse moved over the link.
- Improved acquisition/output methods: Right now, the user writes Perl code to
  acquire the data and output it. Since the code has to work within the
  context of HandleGeneric, it has to use @grabbedData. This results in
  wierdness like GetText returning it's data in the first element of the
  @grabbedData array.
- Real manipulation of the output HTML syntax tree: Right now I just output a
  hunk of HTML when a tag is seen. But for more advanced stuff, like
  javascript in the header, I should really be manipulating the abstract
  syntax tree for the output HTML.
- Have automatic download of the schemas from my webpage whenever someone
  tries to use a tag that's unknown.
- Along that same line, it would be nice if the schemas were "plugins" in the
  sense that they were more generic code. People could write plugins that
  utilized my "API" of functions, or they could write custom code. Right now,
  any schema that requires non-standard code, I have to write support for. On
  the other hand, it could be the case that there aren't too many of those...
- The flat scheme used to identify tags is not very scalable. Maybe something
  like <news sitename=X> might be better, where X might be slashdot, BBC, etc.
  Right now the handlers for each tag are identified by the tag name, but this
  scheme would require identification based on tag and attributes. I'm not
  sure how to do this cleanly. (Do you know? :)
