The purpose of this document is twofold: to give you an idea of what I'd like
to do in future versions of DailyUpdate, and to give you an idea of what you
can help me implement. :) The more help I get, the faster these ideas will be
implemented. Also, if you have any thoughts on these, please let me know.

- Fix the #! for Win32 installations.
- Figure out how to do chmod in the Makefile.PL so that everything isn't
  read-only. (Works for Unix, but not Windows.)
- Make the install routine okay when overwriting old installations.
- Make a RPM distribution.
- Tooltips: Some website present information-less headlines, and a blurb
  explaining the headline. It would be nice if the blurb popped up when the
  user's mouse moved over the link.
- Real manipulation of the output HTML syntax tree: Right now I just output a
  hunk of HTML when a tag is seen. But for more advanced stuff, like
  javascript in the header, I should really be manipulating the abstract
  syntax tree for the output HTML.
- Cache the web pages locally for faster access and off-line reading. This
  pushes Daily Update into the realm of agents, which I'm not sure I want to
  venture into...
- Implement support for last modified checks based on web server information.
- Write a handler to interface DU to local information stored in databases.
- Fix the handlers page to support "what's new", web-based submission,
  searching, etc.
- Write a handler to check for new handlers. :)
